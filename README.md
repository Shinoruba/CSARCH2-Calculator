# CSARCH2 Calculator
This program was developed to help aid my calculations for Exam #3, which was conducted online. The program includes calculations for the following topics:

1. Sequential Circuit Binary Multiplier
2. Restoring Division
3. Non-Restoring Division

## Features

### Sequential Circuit Binary Multiplier
This feature simulates the process of binary multiplication using a sequential circuit. It provides the 'A', 'Q' , 'Q(-1)' , then the final result of 'Q' , 'A' , and the product itself in both binary and integer.

### Restoring Division
This feature demonstrates the restoring division algorithm. It provides the 'A' & 'Q' using the restoring division method.

### Non-Restoring Division
This feature illustrates the non-restoring division technique. It provides the 'A' & 'Q' using the non-restoring division method.

## Acknowledgements
- This project was developed due to my laziness in manual computation.
- Special thanks to my instructor's guidance in teaching this difficult ahh course.
